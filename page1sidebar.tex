\cvsection{Research}
\cvproject{EACL 2021 Paper: Co-evolution of language and agents in referential games}
\textbf{Gautier Dagan}, Dieuwke  Hupkes, and Elia Bruni
\\
Research on language evolution, bridging traditional Linguistic theories and Deep Learning
\begin{itemize}
    \item Simulated language evolution through Referential Games and Neural Architecture Search algorithms
    \item Analysed emerged languages in a multi-agent and multi-modal setting
    % \item Under review at EACL 2021, available as \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.03361}{Arvix Preprint}
\end{itemize}{}

\cvproject{ACL 2020 Paper: Location Attention for Extrapolation to Longer Sequences}

Collaborative research project through the ILLC to replicate and expand on Location Attention

\begin{itemize}
    \item Experimented with new attention mechanisms and tested on Language Modelling baselines
    \item Implemented state-of-the-art Sequence-to-Sequence models and outperformed baseline metrics using proposed technique
    \item Accepted to ACL 2020, available as \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.03872}{Arvix Preprint}
\end{itemize}{}

\cvproject{ECCV 2018 Workshop Paper: Adding Object Detection Skills to Visual Dialogue Agents}
Published research paper at the 2018 EECV Workshop on Shortcomings in Vision and Language
\begin{itemize}
    \item Adapted a Mask R-CNN in a Visual Dialog agent to improve performance on the GuessWhat?! task    
    \item Replaced ground truth images using predictions allowing, for the first time, inference on unlabelled images
\end{itemize}


% \cvproject{Global and Local Critical Policy Learning for Abstractive Summarization }

% Research project for the 2018 Information Retrieval II course

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Replicated and surpassed state-of-the-art abstract summarisation methods by optimising ROUGE score directly instead of through standard Maximum-Likelihood-Estimation
% \end{itemize}{}
